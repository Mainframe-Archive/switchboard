## About

The Switchboard open source project provides high level tools for managing
IMAP clients across email accounts and providers. It's aim is to free
you from the plumbing of server-side email handling, allowing you to
focus on your products and services.

Switchboard was developed by Thomas Moulia in 2014 with the
sponsorship of [Spatch](http://spatch.co/), an innovative startup that
seeks to transform the way email communication works. The decision
was driven by the belief that great things can be done to improve
email management and everybody should be free to do that without
constraints.

Switchboard remains and always will be a liberally licensed open
source project. People are welcome to contribute to Switchboard core
and develop new features as well as create all kinds of workers using
the Switchboard client API.
